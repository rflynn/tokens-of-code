# Tokens of Code (ToC)

> "Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming." â€” Brian Kernighan

The more code you have, the more bugs you have[1].

How can source code complexity be measured?

Commonly, program complexity is measured by Source Lines of Code (LoC or SLoC)[2].

While LoC is widely acknowledged as a poor measure[3], everyone uses it anyway.

## Entropy

1. Number of tokens
2. Number of people using the code
3. Similarly-named tokens
3.1. Exacerbated if indistinguishable by type (e.g. int rev, dev;)
